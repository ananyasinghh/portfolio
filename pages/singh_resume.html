                <h2>Career Goal</h2>
                <p1> My career goal is to become a biotechnician. </p1>
            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p2> Currently attending Dublin High School in Dublin, CA and have been enrolled for 1 year. Further, worked on the following applicable courseworks:</p2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Socratic Seminar- A sacratic seminar, an activity in english, is where a random question is chosen from a list of questions that we had previously seen on a topic we had been discussing. The class is expected to have a casual conversation building on or disproving other classmates views on the subject. It improved my quick-thinking skills and forced me to be able to rebut any arguement with evidence before someone else began to speak, similar to a debate.</li>
                        <li>Yearbook Editor- In middle school, my elective was yearbook for 2 years in a row and was promoted to cheif editor of the academic section during the second year. The regular students wrote the majority of the paragraphs and took the majority of the photos while the editor made sure that there was absolutely no mistake. The yearbook is purely a student-handled project and the teacher was mostly only there for guidance, putting all of the responsibility of the class on the editors. This forced us to become leaders of our section, demand proper work on time from our peers, and be responsible for any mistake that was found in the entire section, instead of the students who wrote it.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Volunteer/Work Experience</h2>
