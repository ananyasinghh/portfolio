                   If you clicked on this section of my website, interested in my career goals, life aspirations, or simply about me, then you are at the right place. Hello, my name is Ananya Singh. My career goal is to become a biotechnician. I plan to go to Boston University in Massachusetts and want to get a bioinformatics degree from there. To achieve these goals I plan to take multiple science courses throughout my high school and college careers. I have been interested in genetics, biology, and other types of chemistry and life science since elementary school and working in a field where I could put my passions to use has always been a dream of mine. <br /> <br /> I possess analytic characteristics that are beneficial to this job. I am good at analyzing and making conclusions with data quickly. In many lab science courses, I often predict outcomes of experiments with the use of this ability. As well as that, I have execution ability skills that are necessary for this job .I have a strategestic mind and am always efficient in getting tasks done. One of my main skills, however, is public speaking. I have always been confident and strong as a public speaker. I have participated in multiple debate teams and clubs where I have shown this skill.<br /> <br /> Over the years, I have participated in multiple school and club sports teams. Being a team player, I have learned how to cooperate and work well with other people, which has turned into one of my greatest strengths. Being on these teams have also played a big part in teaching me discipline. I currently run track on my high school team where one big rule is to go to practice everyday, whether it is raining, hailing, or the hottest day of the year. Sports have also taught me many skills about communication, using my strengths, reliability, and many others that have made me who I am today. Thank you for reading these short paragraphs about me. Feel free to explore the rest of my website.
